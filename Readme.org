* semantic-namespace/contract.function

This module provides a declarative way to define system functions as semantic entities.
Functions become part of the compound-identity registry and can be queried, inspected,
validated, and composed using ontology tags. No DSL or macro layer is required.

** Function contract

A function is defined as a contract instance with five fields:

- ~:function/impl~  
  The implementation. Receives one map containing the merged semantic context.

- ~:function/context~  
  A set of compound-identity keys that must be present in the input map.  
  If a key refers to another function identity, its ~:function/response~ is merged.

- ~:function/response~  
  A set of compound-identity keys that the function provides in its output.

- ~:function.execution/before~  
  Optional pre-handler (defaults to ~identity~).

- ~:function.execution/after~  
  Optional post-handler (defaults to ~identity~).

The function identity is expressed entirely through compound-identity axes
(e.g. ~:domain/*~, ~:operation/*~, ~:resource/*~, ~:effect/*~, ~:integration/*~,
~:tier/*~, or any project-specific ontology keys).

** Core capabilities

- Semantic reasoning over functions
- Minimal test-context derivation
- Consumer/producer graph construction
- Cross-domain dependency analysis
- Semantic composition of contexts
- Static detection of missing producers or unused outputs
- Architectural constraints via axioms
- Alignment with DI and endpoint modules
- Full participation in the compound-identity registry

** Design goals

- Zero DSL, only data
- Semantic first, runtime second
- Ontology-driven composition
- Declarative system behavior
- Full introspection from definitions
- Uniform identity vocabulary across modules
